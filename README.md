# Box2D Car Racing Reinforcement Learning

This project applies reinforcement learning algorithms to the Box2D CarRacing environment from OpenAI's Gym library.

## Overview

The goal is to train an autonomous agent to navigate a randomly generated racetrack using reinforcement learning techniques. The main used technology to achieve this is tensorflow library and Python language.
